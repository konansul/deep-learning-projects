# Applied Deep Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of practical, applied deep learning projects focused on solving real-world computer vision challenges. The focus is on building and understanding models from scratch, not just using pre-built implementations from PyTorch. Most architectures are coded manually (using nn.Sequential or custom nn.Module classes), so you can clearly see how they work under the hood.

The repository solves various computer vision problems, including image classification, image segmentation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, object localization. I have worked with a number of popular datasets, including MNIST for digit classification, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, ImageNet and TinyImageNet, as well as the Carvana Image Masking Challenge. Each dataset has its own folder in the repository, which contains the implementation, training scripts, and experiments with different architectures.
